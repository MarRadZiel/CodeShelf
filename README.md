**CodeShelf** is a repository of loosely connected projects and code fragments written in C#. Each folder contains a standalone component, utility, or example that can serve as inspiration, a practical coding aid, or a foundation for further development.

Examples:
- ðŸ“… [PolishWorkCalendar](Common/PolishWorkCalendar) â€” a tool for handling workdays and holidays in Poland
- ðŸ§® [BitPacking](Common/BitPacking) â€” helper methods for packing and unpacking bits
  
This repository will be gradually expanded with new code fragments that I find worth keeping and sharing.
