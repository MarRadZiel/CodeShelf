**CodeShelf** is a repository of loosely connected projects and code fragments written in C#. Each folder contains a standalone component, utility, or example that can serve as inspiration, a practical coding aid, or a foundation for further development.

Common Examples:
- 📅 [PolishWorkCalendar](Common/PolishWorkCalendar) — a tool for handling workdays and holidays in Poland
- 🧮 [BitPacking](Common/BitPacking) — helper methods for packing and unpacking bits
- 📏 [ByteSize](Common/ByteSize) — parse, format, and work with byte sizes in a human‑friendly way

Unity Game Engine Examples:
- 📌 [AutoProjectVersion](Unity/CodeShelf/Assets/Snippets/AutoProjectVersion) — Unity editor tool that auto-generates project version numbers from Git history and exports changelogs
- 🎞️ [Easing](Unity/CodeShelf/Assets/Snippets/Easing) — C#/Unity implementation of animation easing functions with live graph and demo scene
- 🗂️ [CustomFileInspector](Unity/CodeShelf/Assets/Snippets/CustomFileInspector) — Unity editor extension for rendering custom inspectors for text and default assets, targeting specific file types like .md, .csv, or folders
- 🧩 [MeshCombiner](Unity/CodeShelf/Assets/Snippets/MeshCombiner) — Unity editor tool for combining multiple meshes in a scene into a single optimized mesh asset, preserving materials
  
This repository will be gradually expanded with new code fragments that I find worth keeping and sharing.
